    <h1>My Eurotrip</h1>
    <div id="Intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Throughout my life I never stayed in one place for very long. I came
        from a military family moving every couple of years. When in college the
        thought of living in the same place for four years straight seemed out of
        the ordinary for me. After reviewing options I found out that at little 
        extra cost I could do an entire semester abroad in a different country.
        Below you will find some of my favorite places that I travelled and what
        you can do there.
      </p>

     <p>
       England was my home away from home at Edge Hill University. Although a lot of this felt normal
       with the day to day routine of going to class and doing homework, being
       in a different country added a neat twist on things. In addition to my
       normal business classes I learned about the founding the United States 
       from the prespective of the country we rebelled against. When not in class
       I still took every opportunity to travel. I saw the Rosetta Stone in the British Library.
       Viewed the priceless Crown Jewels of the royal family. Away from the big city I went
       hiking on the moors that inspired the book Wuthering Heights.

  <h2>Ireland</h2>
  <img src="images/Cliffs-Ireland.png" alt = "Cliffs of Moher">
  <p>
    When visiting Ireland I had a friend to stay with who was also going to university. I met a lot of Irish natives in Limerick playing a pick up game
    of ultimate frisbee. Upon their reccomendations I then took a bus trip up to the Cliffs of Moher and hiked along the cliffside. If you are looking
    for a beautiful but scary place to travel walking along the cliff made my stomach turn. However it is one of my favorite places I have ever been.

<h2>Germany</h2>
<img src="images/Waterfall-Germany.png" alt = "Triburg Waterfall">
<p>
I started off my journey in Friedrichshafen the birthplace of the Zeppelin. After that I crossed 
lake Constance on a ferry to proceed with my Switzerland trip. Once that was concluded though I 
crossed back over into Germany on a train up into the black forest. I saw the waterfall at Triberg 
and hiked through the forest. After sleeping on a hill outside of the airport I flew back to
my home in england.

</ul>

<div id="Switzerland">
<h2>Switzerland</h2>
<img src="images/Lion-Switzerland.png" alt = "Lucern Lion">
<p>
Switzerland overall was my favorite country to visit however I would not reccomend doing so on a tight budget.
After going to an ATM and getting hundreds instead of the expected 20s I knew my wallet would hurt. (about a 1 to 1 exchange ratio).
If on a budget I still enjoyed looking at the rich cities, and in Lucern found a quaint park with a giant Chess Board free to the public.
I had a four day train pass to anywhere and also jumped into a river in the Swiss Alps. If you are a thrillseeker like me I would reccomend
Interlaken. There you can find all sorts of mountainside activities. I also found a zipline park with unlimited tree top climbing and ziplines
as long as you had the engergy to continue.
